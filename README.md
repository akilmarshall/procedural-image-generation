# Pocedural Image Generation

How can I turn a single image into more images that are somewhat like it?

## tiled-image-tool

A binary (tit) for computing statistics from tiled images and procedurally
generating new images.

## Theory

$\mathbb{I}$ denotes a tiled image, that is an image composed of a **tile sheet**
(a set of rectangular images).


[diagram: tile sheet $\to$ tiled image]


$\mathbb{T}$ denotes the tile sheet of $\mathbb{I}$,
$$
    \mathbb{T} &= \\{t_0, t_1, \cdots{}, t_n\\}
$$
$$
     \left\mathbb{T}\right &= n,
$$
each tile sheet $\mathbb{T}$ contains $n$ items each denoted $t_i$ where $0\leq i \lt n$.

Each image $\mathbb{I}$ also has the associated **neighbor** function,

$$
    \mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{I}}::t\to d\to \[t\],
$$

that takes a tile and a direction and returns a list of the tiles seen adjacent in the specified direction (in $\mathbb{I}$).

## Image Generation

### pygen

A module to facilitate quick experimenting of image generation strategies.

### Fragments

A fragment is a 3x3 tiled image with a single fixed tile.

```
A B C
D E F
G H I
```

Center Fragment:

The center tile is fixed, {F, B, D, H} can be directly inferred from E via TIS.

```
  b
d E f
  h
```
  
The above is known as the set of core images of E where {f, b, d, h} vary over {F, B, D, H}.
For any core its corners are varied over the set intersections of it's neighbors.

```
A = B \intersection D
C = B \intersection F
G = D \intersection I
I = H \intersection F
```

### Questions

- Are all fragment generation strategies made equal? Does it matter if I fix the center or a corner?:
    - counter example says NO.

## Todo

- pursue image generation via fragment database. TIS -> DB -> Image GEN
    - can this be done without the database? TIS -> Image GEN
